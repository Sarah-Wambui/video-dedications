## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# video-dedications

## Dedication flow (new)

This project now includes a 4-step dedication flow:

- Landing: `/dedicate` — warm welcome and CTA
- Details: `/dedicate/details` — donor form with validation
- Payment: `/dedicate/payment/{dedication}` — Stripe payment (placeholder)
- Success: `/dedicate/success` — confirmation and receipt

Files of interest:

- `app/Models/Dedication.php` — Dedication model
- `database/migrations/*_create_dedications_table.php` — migration
- `app/Http/Controllers/DedicationController.php` — flow controller
- `app/Http/Controllers/StripeWebhookController.php` — webhook handler
- `app/Mail/DonorReceipt.php`, `app/Mail/AdminNotification.php` — mailables
- `resources/views/dedicate/*` — blade views

Stripe setup (recommended):

1. Add the following to your `.env`:

	- STRIPE_SECRET=
	- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

2. Create a PaymentIntent for $180 USD on the backend when loading the payment page and return the client secret to the view. Attach metadata including `dedication_id`.

3. Configure a Stripe webhook endpoint to POST to `/webhook/stripe` and set the signing secret in `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

The current implementation includes placeholders for Stripe client integration. Implement PaymentIntent creation and Stripe Elements mounting in `DedicationController::payment` view.
